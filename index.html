                <p> I’m a third-year journalism major at the University of Florida with a focus in design and online journalism. On the side, I freelance for several publications including the University of Florida's school newspaper, The Alligator, and The Gainesville Sun. </p>

<p> Previously, I have interned with an architecture and interior design firm and with Gainesville Fashion Week.</p>

<p>In my spare time I love to paint, take dance class, practice yoga and run around with my dog Stevie. </p>
